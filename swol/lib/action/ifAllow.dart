//NOTE: according to "https://pub.dev/packages/notification_permissions"

//DEFAULT STATE
//In iOS, a permission is unknown when the user hasnâ€™t accepted or refuse the notification permissions. 
//In Android this state will never occur, 
//  since the permission will be granted by default 
//  and it will be denied if the user goes to the app settings and turns off notifications for the app.

//ACTION
//In iOS, if the permission is unknown, it will show an alert window asking the user for the permission. 
//  On the other hand, if the permission is denied it has the same behaviour as Android, opening the app settings
//On Android, if the permission is denied, this method will open the app settings.

//STATUS can be everything except GRANTED
